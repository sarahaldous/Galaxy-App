Welcome to my Galaxy Explorer app!

This project came about because I discovered the amazing APIs that National Geographic and Nasa make available, and I wanted to find a way to make it easy for people to enjoy the wonders of the world and the universe!

If you click on Menu, a full-page menu with 3 options appears. "Explore the Earth" will take you to pictures (and if you click "More Info", to additional information and a link to the article) from National Geographic. "See the Planet" will take you to one of a series of Unsplash images of the earth. Selecting "Explore the Galaxy" takes you to the beautiful Nasa picture of the day, with the option of viewing it in HD and having the astronomer's explanation of the photo superimposed on the image.
